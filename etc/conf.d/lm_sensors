# This file is sourced by /etc/init.d/lm_sensors and defines the modules to
# be loaded/unloaded.
#
# The format of this file is a shell script that simply defines variables:
# HWMON_MODULES for hardware monitoring driver modules, and optionally
# BUS_MODULES for any required bus driver module (for example for I2C or SPI).

# Load modules at startup
LOADMODULES=yes

# Initialize sensors at startup
INITSENSORS=yes

HWMON_MODULES="coretemp"

# For compatibility reasons, modules are also listed individually as variables
#    MODULE_0, MODULE_1, MODULE_2, etc.
# Please note that the numbers in MODULE_X must start at 0 and increase in
# steps of 1. Any number that is missing will make the init script skip the
# rest of the modules. Use MODULE_X_ARGS for arguments.
#
# You should use BUS_MODULES and HWMON_MODULES instead if possible.

MODULE_0=coretemp
